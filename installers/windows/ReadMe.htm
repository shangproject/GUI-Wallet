<h2>Preface</h2>

  <p>This ReadMe does not aim to be a complete introduction to Shangcoin. If you are new to Shangcoin or even to
    cryptocurrencies in general you find a good introduction on reddit at
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Shangcoin/comments/5zgail/rshangcoin_newcomers_please_read_everything_you_need/">Newcomers Please Read. Everything You Need To Know</a>.
    You also find a lot of good tutorials on <a href="https://www.shangcoin.how/">Shangcoin.How</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Please note that Shangcoin and its software are constantly evolving and progressing; it probably won't take
  long for some of the information here to become outdated.
  </p>

<h2>Content of the Package</h2>

  <p>You just installed the Beta 2 of the <i>Shangcoin GUI Wallet</i> for Windows, more exact version 0.10.3.1. The wallet
  enables you to send and receive shangcoinj in a secure and very private way.
  </p>

  <p>Also included is the <i>Shangcoin daemon</i>, so you have everything now to run a so-called <i>full node</i>
  and become part of the network of nodes that manages the Shangcoin blockchain; you don't need to install additional
  packages in order to start.</p>

  <p>For checking whether there are already newer versions of this package you can go to the
  <a href="https://getshangcoin.org/downloads/">Downloads</a> page on <a href="https://getshangcoin.org/home">getshangcoin.org</a>,
  the official Shangcoin site.</p> 

<h2>Access to the Blockchain</h2>

  <p>Any Shangcoin wallet needs access to the <i>blockchain</i>, the ongoing ledger of all Shangcoin transactions. For the
  GUI wallet there are two principal ways to get that access: You can let Shangcoin sync with the network
  i.e. let it download the blockchain and store it locally on your computer, or you can configure your wallet to
  access a remote <i>open node</i> to get indirect access to the blockchain.</p>

  <p>Working with your own copy of the blockchain is <b>preferred</b>: It strengthens the Shangcoin network, and it
  provides the most security and privacy possible for you.</p>

  <p>However if your Internet access makes it difficult to run a full node, or if you have simply no room to store
  the blockchain locally (over 17 GB in summer 2017, and of course growing), you can compromise and try to connect
  to a remote node. One way of finding such a node is checking
  <a href="https://shangcoinworld.com/pages/nodes.html">this page</a>.
  </p>

<h2>Initial Blockchain Download</h2>

  <p>Please do read the following <b>before</b> jumping right in and starting the GUI wallet:</p>

  <p>If you decide to work with your own copy of the blockchain, which you should whenever possible, you have to
  download it first; it's not part of the installed package.
  Beside the GUI wallet there is second program, the so-called <i>Shangcoin daemon</i>, which will carry out that download.
  You find it in the <i>Utilities</i> sub-folder of the program group.</p>

  <p>Depending on your Internet access and the speed of your computer this can take
  <b>several hours</b>, in some cases <b>more than a day</b>. Furthermore there are unfortunate cases where the
  download gets stuck somehow or doesn't work at all, e.g. because a firewall prevents access to other nodes of the
  Shangcoin network.</p>

  <p>The GUI wallet can start the daemon for you, but that way you will not see much during initial blockchain
  download, especially you probably won't see any error messages in case something goes wrong. By starting the
  daemon yourself "by hand" using the <i>Shangcoin Daemon</i> icon in the <i>Utilities</i> sub-folder of the
  Shangcoin program group you will see it running and displaying messages in a separate window.</p>
   
  <p>If all goes well the daemon will finally display a message like this:
  <i>You are now synchronized with the network.</i></p>

  <p><b>Then</b> you are ready for sure to start your Shangcoin adventures by starting the GUI wallet.</p>

<h2>Allowing Other Nodes to Connect to Your Node</h2>

  <p>When the Shangcoin daemon downloads the blockchain it does so by connecting to other nodes of the network.</p>

  <p>If you allow incoming TCP/IP connections to port 18080 on your computer and let your daemon run for extended
  periods of time you can "return the favor" and help others in turn to get access to Shangcoin. However, depending on
  your Internet connection, firewall, modem, router, ISP etc. this might not be possible, and opening a port in such
  a way usually requires some technical knowledge.</p>

  <p>If you want to try you may start e.g. with
  <a href="https://shangcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/2479/how-do-i-enable-incoming-connections-eli5">this Shangcoin Stack Exchange</a>
  question.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

  <p>The Shangcoin software and especially the GUI wallet are "work in progress", as you can expect seeing the word
  <i>Beta</i> in the name of the package, and sometimes things go wrong.</p>

  <p>Please note that despite any technical problems that you may encounter your shangcoinj are almost always safe: You may
  not be able to move them or you even may not see how many you currently have, but you most probably won't loose any.
  But do remember that the seed needed to re-create the wallet <b>is</b> critical, however: <b>Never loose your
  seed!</b></p>

  <p>There is a <b>bug</b> in this beta of the GUI wallet that triggers if it is installed in a path that contains spaces /
  blank characters, like the default location for Windows programs <i>C:\Program Files</i> unfortunately does.
  Symptoms are problems in the communication between the wallet and the daemon, e.g. the wallet not "seeing" the
  daemon and then not knowing whether it is "synchronized" with the network and thus ready to work or not. You can
  avoid these problems by starting the daemon yourself, with the help of the <i>Shangcoin Daemon</i> icon in the
  <i>Utilities</i> sub-folder of the Shangcoin program group.</p>

  <p>In the <i>Utilities</i> sub-folder there are several more icons that may help you to solve problems.
  These are the icons with a <i>x</i> in front and the name <i>(in parenthesis)</i> to make them visually stand
  apart from the "normal" ones because you will probably only need them in case of trouble, but not during normal
  usage of Shangcoin.</p>

  <p>Here an overview and short info what each icon does:</p>

  <table cellpadding="3" border="1">
    <tr>
      <td><i>x (Try GUI Wallet Low Graphics Mode)</i></td>
      <td>Run the GUI wallet in a mode that allows for low-graphics
        environments, e.g. systems with very simple non-hardware-accelerated or emulated / virtualized video cards;
       also try if the display is simply slow or lags
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><i>x (Try Daemon, Exit Confirm)</i></td>
      <td>
        Run the Shangcoin daemon in a window that does not automatically close if
        the daemon should exit because of a fatal error; useful in cases where the normal daemon icon
        just leads to a window that closes right away
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><i>x (Try Kill Daemon)</i></td>
      <td>
        Kill any running daemon (technically, any process called <i>shangcoind.exe</i>), whether
        with or without any visible window, for starting "with a clean slate"; easier than
        killing such tasks with the help of the Windows Task Manager
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><i>x (Check GUI Wallet Log)</i></td>
      <td>Open the log with status and error messages of the GUI wallet program in Notepad;
      experienced people have a chance to diagnose technical problems with the wallet by looking at the last few lines
      of this log</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><i>x (Check Daemon Log)</i></td>
      <td>
        Open the log with status and error messages of the daemon in Notepad; again, the last few
        lines of this (possible very long) log are the most important for troubleshooting
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><i>x (Check Default Wallet Folder)</i></td>
      <td>
        Open the standard wallet folder in Windows Explorer; useful e.g. if you want to backup
        your wallets
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><i>x (Check Blockchain Folder)</i></td>
      <td>
        Open the folder containing the blockchain in Windows Explorer
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
